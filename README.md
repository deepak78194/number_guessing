This a Beginner level Python Project for practice:

1. Number_guessing:
          
          In This Number Guessing python project: 
                                        1. Computer take the value for limit from the player.
                                        2. Next the computer will save on value between your limit using random module.
                                        3. The game will start, The player want to keep quessing the number until the correct value.

2. Number_guessing_computer:
          
          In This Number Guessing python project:
                                       1. Computer take the value for limit from the player.
                                       2. Next the user want to enter the value, which value the computer want to guess ( Value must be in limit).
                                       3. Then the Computer will start to guess the number.
                                       4. For each guess the computer will show you the number,if the number is greater enter high or if the number is low enter low.
                                       5. So the computer will alter it guess as per your input, Once the computer shows the correct value enter correct.
                                       6. The game will end.
